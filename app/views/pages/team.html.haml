          %a{:href => "http://space.coop", :target => "_blank"}Space Cooperative
          is the founding entity behind Space Decentral, and one that will be capable of interfacing with the real world when necessary such as for procuring launch licenses or remitting checks to contractors that do not accept cryptocurrency. However it should be noted that Space Cooperative will not wholly own Space Decentral. Members of Space Cooperative will act as the initial stewards of Space Decentral with the aim for it to flourish and grow to be a network where multiple organizations and individuals can share value.
